# Dotfiles-Playbook

Ansible playbooks for Managing my Linux (Ubuntu, Fedora) and Windows Machines

## Prerequisites

Works on Linux (Fedora, Ubuntu distributions) and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2) Ubuntu.

## Usage

Run `bootstrap.sh`.

- When run on a Linux machine, Ansible configures the system it is run on
- When run in WSL, Ansible will configure Windows hosting WSL

### What the Script Does

- Script will check the Linux distribution and run the appropriate Ansible playbook and install required software and Ansible requirements for the target system.
- Playbook is designed to work with a repository containing dotfiles and configuration files like my [dotfiles](https://github.com/justunsix/dotfiles) repository. These are configured in the configuration `yaml` files in the `group-vars` and `host-vars` folders.

### Overriding Defaults

- Variables used by Ansible can be overridden with a `config.yml` file in the root of the repository. Optionally, another configuration `yaml` file specified in a repository that contains vars files such as `dotfiles-overlay` defined in the `default-config.yml`.
- These files can be helpful to override variables for different machines or environments and manage secrets outside of this repository.

## Roadmap

- Make Ansible vars and tasks more flexible instead of hardcoding values with:
  - Use [`ansible.builtin.setup`](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/setup_module.html) settings
    - `Ansible_distribution` for conditionals on Fedora and Ubuntu playbook
  - Build on `default_config.yaml` and override for Fedora
- Set up [Ansible logging](https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/latest/html/administration/logging.html) to more easily read output outside the terminal
